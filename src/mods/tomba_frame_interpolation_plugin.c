 * Presentation-only frame interpolation, moved out of generic recomp-ui
 * Settings into the mod catalog (game.toml sets
 * [video] offer_frame_interpolation = false), joining the widescreen and
 * Skip FMVs features Tomba already owns as mods.
 *
 * Deliberately psx_mod_set_frame_interpolation and NOT
 * psx_mod_set_native_vblank_rate: the former blends between completed guest
 * frames and leaves VBlank, logic, timers, and audio at their stock cadence,
 * while the latter changes whole-machine realtime speed. Conflating the two is
 * how "smoother" turns into "the game runs fast", so this package exposes only
 * the presentation half.
